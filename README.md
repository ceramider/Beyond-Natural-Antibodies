Beyond Natural Antibodies: A novel anti-3CLpro Nanobody NB1 using Large Language Model based on Segmented Generation

**[Extended Data Figure 1](https://github.com/ceramider/Beyond-Natural-Antibodies/blob/main/Extended%20Data%20Figure%201.pdf)**: Toxicity of two sets of sequences (Fragment-based generated nanobodies and nanobody library)

**[Extended Data Figure 2](https://github.com/ceramider/Beyond-Natural-Antibodies/blob/main/Extended%20Data%20Figure%202.pdf)**: Details of the interactions of Nb1 and S43 with the variant complexes, and of the interactions of Nb1 and S43 upon simultaneous binding to the same antigens. (A1-10) Docking details between Nb1 and individual variants; (B1-10) Docking details between S43 and individual variants; (C1-10) Docking details of Nb1 and S43 competing to bind the same variant.

**[Extended Data Figure 3](https://github.com/ceramider/Beyond-Natural-Antibodies/blob/main/Extended%20Data%20Figure%203.pdf)**: Potential energy changes when Nb5 and S43 bind to the variants, respectively, and when they compete simultaneously for the same antigen. (A1-10) Potential energy changes when Nb1 binds to a variant; (B1-10) Potential energy changes when S43 binds to a variant; (C1-10) Potential energy changes when Nb1 and S43 compete to bind the same variant.

**[Extended Data Table](https://github.com/ceramider/Beyond-Natural-Antibodies/blob/main/Extended%20Data%20Table.pdf)**: Interaction forces generated when nanobodies bind to variants. (I-X) Interaction forces generated when Nb1 is variant with each variant; (XI-XX) Interaction forces generated when S43 is variant with each variant; (XXI-XL) Interaction forces generated when Nb1 and S43 compete to bind the same variant.
